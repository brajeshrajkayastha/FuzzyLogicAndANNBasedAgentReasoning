# FuzzyLogicAndANNBasedAgentReasoning

This is a simple AI reasoning implementation which can be a base for a game AI. It is a simple implementation of Fuzzy Logic and Artifical Neural Network combination to provide reasoning for a game AI agent. Fuzzy logic is developed using **Triangle** and **Trapezium Membership functions**. Defuzzification is achieved by using **Weighted Average**. Simplest ANN is created with neurons and layers. **A* path finding** algorithm has been implemented but not used. 

C++ is used for the implementation.
